# WebGL Knowledge Reinforcement

This repo is my playground for revisiting WebGL concepts to solidify my knowledge. It offers a learning path for others interested in 3D graphics programming on the web.

## What's Planned Inside

-   **Fundamentals**: Core WebGL concepts, coordinate systems, and the graphics pipeline
-   **Three.js Integration**: Leveraging Three.js for more efficient 3D development
-   **React Integration**: Combining WebGL and Three.js with React applications
-   **Advanced Techniques**: Performance optimization, shaders, and visual effects

_Note: This README will be updated regularly as I add new examples and insights._

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open examples directly in your browser
3. Follow the folders sequentially for thorough understanding

## Requirements

-   Modern browser with WebGL support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
-   Basic JavaScript knowledge
-   Text editor for code experimentation

## Resources

-   [WebGL Official Documentation](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/)
-   [Three.js Documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/)
-   [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/)
