# WebGL Fundamentals

This section covers the core concepts required to understand WebGL.

## Contents

1. **What is WebGL?** - Introduction to the WebGL API and its capabilities
2. **Coordinate System** - Understanding WebGL's coordinate space
3. **Triangles Everywhere** - How complex 3D shapes are built from triangles
4. **Rendering Pipeline** - The journey from data to pixels

## Key Concepts

-   **WebGL Context**: How JavaScript interfaces with the GPU
-   **Shaders**: Small programs that run on the GPU
-   **Vertices & Fragments**: The building blocks of WebGL
-   **Buffers & Attributes**: How data flows to the GPU

## Learning Approach

Each example builds progressively, introducing a single concept at a time. We recommend following them in order for the most effective learning experience.
