# Blinn-Phong Lighting in WebGL 2

## Introduction to Lighting Concepts

### Purpose of Lighting in 3D Graphics

Lighting is an essential component of 3D graphics that transforms flat, lifeless geometry into rich, three-dimensional scenes. Without lighting, 3D objects would appear flat and lack visual depth, making it difficult for viewers to perceive their shape, material properties, and spatial relationships.

Effective lighting serves multiple crucial purposes:

-   **Revealing Shape and Form**: Lighting highlights contours and surfaces, allowing viewers to perceive the 3D structure of objects.
-   **Creating Depth and Atmosphere**: Shadows and highlights provide depth cues that help establish spatial relationships in a scene.
-   **Conveying Material Properties**: The way light interacts with a surface communicates whether objects are shiny, rough, metallic, or translucent.
-   **Directing Attention**: Strategic lighting can guide the viewer's focus toward important elements.
-   **Setting Mood and Tone**: The color, intensity, and placement of lights significantly impact the emotional response to a scene.

### Overview of Blinn-Phong

The Blinn-Phong lighting model is a widely used empirical shading technique in computer graphics. It approximates how light interacts with surfaces by combining three distinct components:

1. **Ambient**: A constant illumination that simulates indirect light bouncing throughout the scene.
2. **Diffuse**: Light scattered equally in all directions from a surface, creating the basic "shape-revealing" illumination.
3. **Specular**: Concentrated highlights that appear on shiny surfaces, simulating direct reflection.

Each component models a different aspect of light-surface interaction, and together they create a reasonably convincing approximation of real-world lighting.

### Historical Context

The Blinn-Phong model has a significant place in the history of computer graphics:

-   It evolved from the Phong reflection model (developed by Bui Tuong Phong in 1975).
-   Jim Blinn's modification in 1977 improved performance by using the "halfway vector" for specular calculations.
-   For decades, it was the standard lighting model in real-time graphics, including early OpenGL and DirectX fixed-function pipelines.
-   While modern rendering often uses physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques, Blinn-Phong remains valuable for its simplicity, efficiency, and visual effectiveness.

Blinn-Phong is an empirical model, meaning it's designed to look plausible rather than simulate actual physics. This distinguishes it from physically-based models, which aim to accurately represent energy conservation and light behavior.

## Components of Blinn-Phong Lighting

### Ambient Component

The ambient component represents indirect illumination that reaches surfaces from all directions due to light bouncing around the environment. In real-world lighting, all surfaces receive some illumination even when not directly facing a light source.

**Implementation**:

```glsl
vec3 ambient = ambientStrength * lightColor;
```

Where:

-   `ambientStrength` is a scalar (typically 0.1-0.3) controlling the intensity
-   `lightColor` is the RGB color of the light source

This approximation is extremely simplified, as it applies the same ambient light to all surfaces regardless of their position or orientation. More advanced techniques like ambient occlusion and global illumination provide more realistic indirect lighting.

### Diffuse Component

The diffuse component simulates light that penetrates a surface, scatters within it, and then exits in all directions. This creates the basic shading that reveals an object's shape and is strongest where the surface directly faces the light source.

The intensity of diffuse reflection depends on the angle between the surface normal and the light direction, calculated using the dot product:

**Implementation**:

```glsl
vec3 normal = normalize(vNormal);
vec3 lightDir = normalize(lightPos - fragPos);

float diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);
vec3 diffuse = diff * lightColor;
```

Where:

-   `normal` is the surface normal vector
-   `lightDir` is the direction from the fragment to the light
-   `max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0)` ensures that surfaces facing away from the light receive no diffuse lighting
-   `lightColor` is the RGB color of the light source

The dot product mathematically captures Lambert's cosine law, which states that the intensity of diffuse reflection is proportional to the cosine of the angle between the normal and light direction.

### Specular Component

The specular component creates shiny highlights that appear when viewing a surface from angles where it would reflect light toward the viewer. These highlights are concentrated and become more focused on highly polished surfaces.

Blinn-Phong's innovation over the original Phong model is using the "halfway vector" (between the light direction and view direction) rather than calculating the perfect reflection vector:

**Implementation**:

```glsl
vec3 viewDir = normalize(viewPos - fragPos);
vec3 halfwayDir = normalize(lightDir + viewDir);

float spec = pow(max(dot(normal, halfwayDir), 0.0), shininess);
vec3 specular = specularStrength * spec * lightColor;
```

Where:

-   `viewDir` is the direction from the fragment to the camera
-   `halfwayDir` is the halfway vector between light and view directions
-   `shininess` controls how focused the highlight appears (higher values create smaller, sharper highlights)
-   `specularStrength` controls the intensity of the specular highlight

The halfway vector approach is both more efficient and often produces more pleasing results than the perfect reflection calculation used in the original Phong model.

### Combination

The final Blinn-Phong lighting calculation combines all three components, multiplying them by the material color:

```glsl
vec3 result = (ambient + diffuse + specular) * objectColor;
```

For colored materials, the object color might be applied differently to each component, particularly in more advanced implementations:

```glsl
vec3 result = (ambient * ambientColor) + (diffuse * diffuseColor) + (specular * specularColor);
```

This combination creates a visually pleasing approximation of surface lighting that captures the essential features of how we perceive illuminated objects.

## Data Requirements for Blinn-Phong

### Vertex Data

Implementing Blinn-Phong lighting requires specific geometric data to be available per vertex:

1. **Vertex Positions**:

    - Needed to calculate the fragment position in world space
    - Used for determining light and view directions

2. **Vertex Normals**:
    - Surface orientation vectors perpendicular to the surface
    - Critical for both diffuse and specular calculations
    - Must be provided per vertex and interpolated across fragments

This data is typically stored in vertex buffers and passed to the shader program through attributes:

```js
// Position buffer setup
const positionBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positionBuffer);
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, positions, gl.STATIC_DRAW);

// Normal buffer setup
const normalBuffer = gl.createBuffer();
gl.bindBuffer(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, normalBuffer);
gl.bufferData(gl.ARRAY_BUFFER, normals, gl.STATIC_DRAW);

// Tell shaders how to retrieve this data
const positionLoc = gl.getAttribLocation(program, 'aPosition');
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(positionLoc);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(positionLoc, 3, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);

const normalLoc = gl.getAttribLocation(program, 'aNormal');
gl.enableVertexAttribArray(normalLoc);
gl.vertexAttribPointer(normalLoc, 3, gl.FLOAT, false, 0, 0);
```

It's important to note that for accurate lighting, normals must be transformed appropriately when the object is transformed. This typically involves using a normal matrix (the transpose of the inverse of the upper-left 3x3 part of the model matrix).

### Uniforms

Blinn-Phong lighting requires several uniforms to be passed from JavaScript to the shaders:

1. **Light Properties**:

    - Light position (for point lights) or direction (for directional lights)
    - Light color
    - Light intensity (often combined with color)

2. **Camera Properties**:

    - Camera/view position (for specular calculations)

3. **Material Properties**:
    - Diffuse color (base color of the object, often from a texture)
    - Specular color (color of highlights, often white or a tint)
    - Shininess (controls the size and focus of specular highlights)
    - Ambient factor (controls how strongly the object responds to ambient light)

Here's how these uniforms might be set up:

```js
// Set up uniforms
const lightPosLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(program, 'uLightPos');
const lightColorLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(program, 'uLightColor');
const viewPosLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(program, 'uViewPos');
const materialDiffuseLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(program, 'uMaterial.diffuse');
const materialSpecularLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(program, 'uMaterial.specular');
const materialShininessLoc = gl.getUniformLocation(program, 'uMaterial.shininess');

// Set uniform values
gl.uniform3f(lightPosLoc, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0);
gl.uniform3f(lightColorLoc, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
gl.uniform3f(viewPosLoc, camera.position.x, camera.position.y, camera.position.z);
gl.uniform3f(materialDiffuseLoc, 0.7, 0.2, 0.2); // Red material
gl.uniform3f(materialSpecularLoc, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0); // White highlights
gl.uniform1f(materialShininessLoc, 32.0);
```

### Data Flow

The flow of data for Blinn-Phong lighting follows the general WebGL 2 data flow pattern discussed in previous lessons:

1. **JavaScript Setup**:

    - Create and populate vertex buffers (positions, normals)
    - Set up uniform values for lights, camera, and materials
    - Configure VAOs to capture attribute state

2. **Vertex Shader Processing**:

    - Receive vertex positions and normals as inputs
    - Transform positions to clip space for rendering
    - Transform positions and normals to appropriate space for lighting (typically world space)
    - Pass interpolated values to fragment shader

3. **Fragment Shader Processing**:
    - Receive interpolated position and normal data
    - Normalize vectors (required due to interpolation)
    - Calculate lighting components using uniforms and interpolated values
    - Output the final fragment color

This data flow builds directly on the foundational concepts covered in the WebGL 2 Data Flow lesson, applying them to the specific case of implementing lighting.

## Implementing Blinn-Phong in Shaders

### Vertex Shader

The vertex shader for Blinn-Phong lighting needs to transform vertices for rendering while also preparing the data needed for lighting calculations in the fragment shader:

```glsl
#version 300 es

// Inputs
in vec3 aPosition;
in vec3 aNormal;

// Uniforms for transformations
uniform mat4 uModelMatrix;
uniform mat4 uViewMatrix;
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;
uniform mat3 uNormalMatrix; // Transpose of the inverse of the model matrix

// Outputs to fragment shader
out vec3 vFragPos;   // Fragment position in world space
out vec3 vNormal;    // Fragment normal in world space

void main() {
    // Transform position to clip space for rendering
    gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * uViewMatrix * uModelMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);

    // Transform position to world space for lighting calculations
    vFragPos = vec3(uModelMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0));

    // Transform normal to world space for lighting calculations
    // Note: We use the normal matrix to ensure normals transform correctly
    vNormal = uNormalMatrix * aNormal;
}
```

Key points in this vertex shader:

1. We transform the vertex position to clip space using the full MVP matrix chain for rendering.
2. We separately transform the position to world space for lighting calculations.
3. We transform the normal using a special normal matrix that preserves perpendicularity even when the model matrix includes non-uniform scaling.
4. Both the world-space position and normal are passed to the fragment shader for per-fragment lighting.

### Fragment Shader

The fragment shader performs the actual Blinn-Phong lighting calculations per pixel:

```glsl
#version 300 es
precision highp float;

// Inputs from vertex shader
in vec3 vFragPos;
in vec3 vNormal;

// Light uniforms
uniform vec3 uLightPos;
uniform vec3 uLightColor;
uniform vec3 uViewPos;

// Material uniforms
uniform struct {
    vec3 diffuse;
    vec3 specular;
    float shininess;
} uMaterial;

// Output
out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
    // Normalize the normal (it may not be unit length after interpolation)
    vec3 normal = normalize(vNormal);

    // Calculate lighting vectors
    vec3 lightDir = normalize(uLightPos - vFragPos);
    vec3 viewDir = normalize(uViewPos - vFragPos);
    vec3 halfwayDir = normalize(lightDir + viewDir);

    // Ambient component
    float ambientStrength = 0.1;
    vec3 ambient = ambientStrength * uLightColor;

    // Diffuse component
    float diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);
    vec3 diffuse = diff * uLightColor;

    // Specular component
    float spec = pow(max(dot(normal, halfwayDir), 0.0), uMaterial.shininess);
    vec3 specular = spec * uMaterial.specular * uLightColor;

    // Optional: Distance attenuation for point lights
    float distance = length(uLightPos - vFragPos);
    float attenuation = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.09 * distance + 0.032 * distance * distance);

    // Apply attenuation to diffuse and specular (not usually to ambient)
    diffuse *= attenuation;
    specular *= attenuation;

    // Combine all components
    vec3 result = (ambient + diffuse) * uMaterial.diffuse + specular;
    fragColor = vec4(result, 1.0);
}
```

Key points in this fragment shader:

1. We normalize the interpolated normal to ensure it's a unit vector (interpolation can change its length).
2. We calculate the light direction, view direction, and halfway vector per fragment.
3. Each component of the Blinn-Phong model is calculated separately:
    - Ambient: simple constant factor
    - Diffuse: based on the dot product of normal and light direction
    - Specular: based on the dot product of normal and halfway vector, raised to a power
4. We include distance attenuation for point lights using a commonly-used quadratic attenuation formula.
5. We combine all components, applying diffuse material color to ambient and diffuse components and specular material color to the specular component.

### Multiple Lights Extension

To extend this to handle multiple lights, we can modify the fragment shader:

```glsl
#version 300 es
precision highp float;

#define MAX_LIGHTS 4

in vec3 vFragPos;
in vec3 vNormal;

// Light struct and array
struct Light {
    vec3 position;
    vec3 color;
};
uniform Light uLights[MAX_LIGHTS];
uniform int uLightCount;

uniform vec3 uViewPos;
uniform struct {
    vec3 diffuse;
    vec3 specular;
    float shininess;
} uMaterial;

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
    vec3 normal = normalize(vNormal);
    vec3 viewDir = normalize(uViewPos - vFragPos);

    // Ambient is usually applied once, not per light
    float ambientStrength = 0.1;
    vec3 ambient = ambientStrength * vec3(1.0); // Using white ambient

    vec3 result = ambient * uMaterial.diffuse;

    // Process each light
    for(int i = 0; i < uLightCount; i++) {
        // Skip if we exceed the maximum number of lights
        if(i >= MAX_LIGHTS) break;

        vec3 lightDir = normalize(uLights[i].position - vFragPos);
        vec3 halfwayDir = normalize(lightDir + viewDir);

        // Diffuse
        float diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);
        vec3 diffuse = diff * uLights[i].color;

        // Specular
        float spec = pow(max(dot(normal, halfwayDir), 0.0), uMaterial.shininess);
        vec3 specular = spec * uMaterial.specular * uLights[i].color;

        // Attenuation
        float distance = length(uLights[i].position - vFragPos);
        float attenuation = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.09 * distance + 0.032 * distance * distance);

        diffuse *= attenuation;
        specular *= attenuation;

        // Add contribution from this light
        result += (diffuse * uMaterial.diffuse + specular);
    }

    fragColor = vec4(result, 1.0);
}
```

This extension allows handling multiple light sources, each contributing to the final illumination of the fragment.

## Common Pitfalls and Debugging

### Vector Normalization

One of the most common issues in lighting calculations is forgetting to normalize vectors:

-   **Normal Vectors**: Always normalize after interpolation in the fragment shader, as interpolation can change vector lengths.
-   **Light and View Directions**: These should be normalized to ensure correct dot product calculations.
-   **Halfway Vector**: Must be normalized to ensure proper specular calculations.

Incorrect normalization often results in dimmer lighting, incorrect specular highlights, or visual inconsistencies across a surface.

### Coordinate Spaces

Consistency in coordinate spaces is crucial for correct lighting:

-   **Choose One Space**: Typically, world space or view space is used for lighting calculations.
-   **Transform Consistently**: Ensure positions, normals, light positions, and view position are all in the same space.
-   **Normal Matrix**: When using world space, remember to use the normal matrix (transpose of the inverse of the model matrix) for transforming normals, especially when the model matrix includes non-uniform scaling.

Mixing coordinate spaces often leads to incorrect lighting direction or strange artifacts as the object moves or rotates.

### Debugging Tips

When lighting doesn't look right, try these debugging techniques:

1. **Visualize Normals as Colors**:

    ```glsl
    // Debugging: Visualize normals as colors
    vec3 normalColor = normalize(vNormal) * 0.5 + 0.5; // Remap from [-1,1] to [0,1]
    fragColor = vec4(normalColor, 1.0);
    ```

2. **Isolate Components**:

    ```glsl
    // Debug: Show only ambient
    fragColor = vec4(ambient * uMaterial.diffuse, 1.0);

    // Debug: Show only diffuse
    fragColor = vec4(diffuse * uMaterial.diffuse, 1.0);

    // Debug: Show only specular
    fragColor = vec4(specular, 1.0);
    ```

3. **Check Intermediate Values**:

    ```glsl
    // Debug: Visualize the dot product between normal and light direction
    float dotNL = dot(normal, lightDir);
    fragColor = vec4(vec3(max(dotNL, 0.0)), 1.0);
    ```

4. **Try Simplified Materials**:

    - Use pure white diffuse and specular colors to eliminate material color as a factor.
    - Set shininess to a moderate value like 32 to ensure visible but not overly tight highlights.

5. **Add Console Logging in JavaScript**:
    - Log uniform values to ensure they're being set correctly.
    - Verify matrix transformations by logging sample transformed positions/normals.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Issue                             | Possible Causes                                             | Solutions                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| Strange patterns in lighting      | Normals not properly normalized; Interpolation issues       | Normalize in fragment shader; Check normal generation      |

## Limitations of Blinn-Phong

### Non-Physical Model

While Blinn-Phong produces visually pleasing results, it has several limitations as a non-physically based model:

1. **Lack of Energy Conservation**:

    - Real-world materials don't create energy; they can only reflect what they receive.
    - Blinn-Phong can easily produce results where more light is reflected than was incident on a surface.

2. **No Fresnel Effect**:

    - In reality, surfaces become more reflective at grazing angles.
    - Blinn-Phong doesn't account for this, making edges of objects appear less realistic.

3. **Limited Material Range**:

    - Cannot accurately represent materials like metals, which have colored specular reflections.
    - Struggles with complex materials like subsurface scattering (skin, marble) or anisotropic materials (brushed metal, hair).

4. **Simplified Light Interaction**:

    - Real-world materials interact with light based on their microscopic surface structure.
    - Blinn-Phong approximates this with a simple shininess parameter.

5. **Limited Global Illumination**:
    - The ambient term is a very crude approximation of indirect lighting.
    - No built-in support for light bouncing or color bleeding.

### Advanced Topics Preview

These limitations have led to the development of more sophisticated lighting models, including Physically Based Rendering (PBR). Future lessons will explore these advanced topics:

1. **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**:

    - Energy-conserving lighting models
    - Metalness/roughness or specular/glossiness workflows
    - Microfacet theory for realistic surface interaction
    - Image-based lighting (IBL) for environment reflections

2. **Advanced Lighting Techniques**:

    - Global illumination approximations
    - Screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO)
    - Area lights and soft shadows
    - Subsurface scattering for translucent materials

3. **Light Transport Algorithms**:
    - Precomputed radiance transfer
    - Light probes and reflection probes
    - Realtime global illumination approximations

Despite its limitations, Blinn-Phong remains valuable for many applications due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to produce good results with minimal computational cost. Understanding it thoroughly provides a solid foundation for exploring more advanced lighting models.

## Complete Example: Blinn-Phong Sphere

Here's a complete WebGL 2 example that renders a sphere with Blinn-Phong lighting:

```javascript
// Vertex shader
const vertexShaderSource = `#version 300 es
in vec3 aPosition;
in vec3 aNormal;

uniform mat4 uModelMatrix;
uniform mat4 uViewMatrix;
uniform mat4 uProjectionMatrix;
uniform mat3 uNormalMatrix;

out vec3 vFragPos;
out vec3 vNormal;

void main() {
    gl_Position = uProjectionMatrix * uViewMatrix * uModelMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0);
    vFragPos = vec3(uModelMatrix * vec4(aPosition, 1.0));
    vNormal = uNormalMatrix * aNormal;
}`;

// Fragment shader
const fragmentShaderSource = `#version 300 es
precision highp float;

in vec3 vFragPos;
in vec3 vNormal;

uniform vec3 uLightPos;
uniform vec3 uLightColor;
uniform vec3 uViewPos;
uniform vec3 uMaterialDiffuse;
uniform vec3 uMaterialSpecular;
uniform float uMaterialShininess;

out vec4 fragColor;

void main() {
    // Normalize vectors
    vec3 normal = normalize(vNormal);
    vec3 lightDir = normalize(uLightPos - vFragPos);
    vec3 viewDir = normalize(uViewPos - vFragPos);
    vec3 halfwayDir = normalize(lightDir + viewDir);
    
    // Ambient
    float ambientStrength = 0.1;
    vec3 ambient = ambientStrength * uLightColor;
    
    // Diffuse
    float diff = max(dot(normal, lightDir), 0.0);
    vec3 diffuse = diff * uLightColor;
    
    // Specular
    float spec = pow(max(dot(normal, halfwayDir), 0.0), uMaterialShininess);
    vec3 specular = spec * uMaterialSpecular * uLightColor;
    
    // Attenuation
    float distance = length(uLightPos - vFragPos);
    float attenuation = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.09 * distance + 0.032 * distance * distance);
    
    diffuse *= attenuation;
    specular *= attenuation;
    
    // Final result
    vec3 result = (ambient + diffuse) * uMaterialDiffuse + specular;
    fragColor = vec4(result, 1.0);
}`;

// JavaScript setup code would follow, creating buffers, compiling shaders, and setting up the rendering loop
```

To implement this, you would need to:

1. Create and compile the shaders
2. Set up VAOs and buffers for a sphere (position and normal data)
3. Set up the appropriate uniform values
4. Create a render loop that updates camera positions and other changing values

This example demonstrates the core principles of Blinn-Phong lighting in WebGL 2 and can serve as a foundation for more complex lighting scenarios.
